# hello_world
This is a trial use of github as part of my NTI-300-3220 class on UNIX
So I am a really great guy who is trying to learn operating systems on LINUX,
This class is starting with helping me to understand how to do git documentation. 
I have not had dinner yet tonight - but my wife was making a steak dinner as I left for school this evening.
